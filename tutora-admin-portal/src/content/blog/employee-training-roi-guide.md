## üìä **What is Employee Training ROI? (And Why It Matters)**

Employee Training ROI measures the financial return on your training investments. But unlike other business metrics, training ROI has both **direct** and **indirect** benefits that compound over time.

### **The ROI Formula:**
```
Training ROI = (Training Benefits - Training Costs) / Training Costs √ó 100
```

### **But Here's What Most Companies Miss:**

Traditional ROI calculations only look at direct costs. Our research shows successful companies track **5 categories of impact**:

1. **Direct Financial Gains** (increased sales, reduced errors)
2. **Cost Avoidance** (lower turnover, fewer accidents) 
3. **Productivity Improvements** (faster task completion, higher quality)
4. **Compliance & Risk Reduction** (avoided fines, insurance savings)
5. **Employee Engagement** (retention, satisfaction, referrals)

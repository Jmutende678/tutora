# ðŸš€ MANUAL DATABASE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## **CRITICAL: Fix Database Issues Immediately**

The Flutter app is showing database errors because the schema hasn't been deployed yet. Follow these steps to fix it:

### **Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sphkmvjfufrjbojfahar
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"

### **Step 2: Execute the Fixed Schema**

Copy and paste the entire content from `lib/config/supabase_schema_fixed.sql` into the SQL editor and click "Run".

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

Run this query to verify the tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see these tables:
- analytics
- certificates
- companies
- leaderboard_entries
- leaderboards
- module_assignments
- modules
- notifications
- questions
- quiz_attempts
- quizzes
- subscriptions
- support_tickets
- ticket_messages
- usage_tracking
- users

### **Step 4: Create Initial Data**

Run this query to create a test company:

```sql
INSERT INTO companies (name, plan_type, max_users, max_ai_modules, max_storage_gb) 
VALUES ('Demo Company', 'growth', 25, 50, 10)
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### **Step 5: Test the Flutter App**

After deploying the schema, the Flutter app should work without database errors.
